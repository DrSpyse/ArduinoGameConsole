Here is a helpful guide for setting up the mp3 player:
https://circuitjournal.com/how-to-use-the-dfplayer-mini-mp3-module-with-an-arduino

IMPORTANT:
To avoid losing track of which file is which number, as soon as you add an audio file to your microSD, rename it "001_Name" or something of the sort.





HOW TO SET UP:

Code:
1.) Download DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h library
2.) Include DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h and SoftwareSerial.h libraries
3.) Copy this and paste in sketch:

	static const uint8_t PIN_MP3_RX = 13;
	static const uint8_t PIN_MP3_TX = 12;
	SoftwareSerial softwareSerial(PIN_MP3_RX, PIN_MP3_TX);
	DFRobotDFPlayerMini player;

4.) Copy this and paste it in setup:
	
	softwareSerial.begin(9600);
  	if(player.begin(softwareSerial)){
    		Serial.println("Audio Setup Successful");
  	} else {
    		Serial.println("Audio Setup Failed");
  	}

*Make sure serial monitor is initialized at a baud rate of 9600


Hardware:
1.) Solder leads onto speaker
2.) Connect Tx pin on mp3 module to pin 12 through a 1k ohm resistor
3.) Connect Rx pin on mp3 module to pin 13
4.) Connect module to ground and 5v
5.) Connect leads on speaker to spk1 and spk2 on mp3 module. Order does not matter.



USAGE:
1.) Add mp3 files from your computer onto a microSD card
2.) Insert microSD card into slot on mp3 module
3.) Set volume of speaker: 	*volume = number from 0 - 30

	player.volume(volume);

4.) Play mp3 file through speaker:	*file_number = index of mp3 file you want to play
	
	player.play(file_number);
